### DC Python Dojo

Join us for an evening of Python coding, food, and silly mistakes.

The way it works is fairly simple:

 6:30 - Everyone votes on a project to work on for the evening

​6:45 - We break up into small groups to work on the problem

​7:45 - Everyone comes back together for show & tell

​8:00 - We adjourn to a local establishment to discuss what went right over beverages
