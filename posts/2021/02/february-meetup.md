### Will Angel - Logging and Monitoring Python Applications

You've built your Python application and deployed it! Now what? Specifically,
now what is your application doing and how do you monitor it. This talk will
cover logging and monitoring Python applications using the Python standard
library logging module and open source monitoring tools including Prometheus
and Grafana. Learn the basics and best practices of application logging, and
get an overview of the monitoring ecosystem that you can use to get better
insights into the health and utilization of your Python apps.
