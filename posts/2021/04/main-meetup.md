### Taylor Bird -  Blueprints for a Serpent

A survey of Python variants. Let's discuss that Python is a specification for a
language of which cPython is just the most popular reference implementation.
We'll talk at a high level about how this is possible and then we'll cover some
examples of alternate implementations of Python, what they offer and why you
might want to use them.
