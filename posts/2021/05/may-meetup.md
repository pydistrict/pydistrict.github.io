### Saran Ahluwalia - Probabilistic Programming using PyStan: Quantifying the business impact of adverse events on networks using device telemetry

Causal Inference has been greatly popularized in the past several years in both
contemporary machine learning and in statistics. Applications include
advertising campaigns, economic analysis and disaster recovery.

But what exactly is "causal inference"? From a statistician's perspective, it
is the study of the consequences of the effects of individuals' actions. This
is really important as one causal phenomena in your data can be more meaningful
than dozens of correlation patterns in your data.

In this talk we will briefly discuss an application of causal inference to
cybersecurity. Objectives in this talk include:

1. An introduction to Bayesian structural time series models
2. An introduction to probabilistic programming using Stan
3. How to construct hierarchical models that can capture more complex dynamics
   of systems
4. An introduction to network traffic analysis and its utility in impacting
   both cybersecurity and the science of causal inference
