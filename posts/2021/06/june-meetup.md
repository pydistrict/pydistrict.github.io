### Sam Scott - Adding Structure to a Sea of Chaos: A principled approach to authorization using Python + SQLAlchemy

Authorization is an unstructured problem. Writing code to decide who can do
what in your app can cover a broad set of cases. The most structure that
typically gets applied to this problem area is a set of if statements and
roles, but in reality, there are a lot more patterns and structure that we can
apply. [Oso](https://www.osohq.com) is an open source batteries-included
library for building authorization in your application. It's a bit like
SQLAlchemy in that it provides a structured approach to authorization, much
like SQLAlchemy does for data modeling and access. In this talk, we'll provide
a mental model for authorization and show how to apply it using oso, Python and
SQLAlchemy.

#### About Sam

Sam Scott is the cofounder and CTO of [Oso](https://www.osohq.com). Heâ€™s
received a PhD in Cryptography, is an engineer by training, and can discuss
anything from authorization and security patterns in SQLAlchemy, to how oso
works under the hood and interfaces with Python via FFI, to trends in security
policy-as-code and his contributions to TLS 1.3.
