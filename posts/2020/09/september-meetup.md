### Justin Shelton - Ball Don't Lie: Extracting Truth from Basketball Games with Python

Plain-text can sometimes be a gold mine for analytical information, but text is
not exactly a well-formed API. We will go in depth on how we tackle the problem
of tagging basketball plays for the purposes of advanced metrics with minimal
work, how we present those metrics, and what to do when the data is a lie.
Attendees will learn event modeling for human-readable text; what metrics and
advanced calculations are possible with seemingly basic data; and data
triage/human input on ground-truth data.

Justin Shelton is the CTO of Pivot Analysis, a company dedicated to basketball
analytics. He helped create and maintains a system for tracking advanced
basketball analytics, showcasing the effects of players on their teams and
surfacing team insights for coaches and analysts. Before coming to Pivot,
Justin spent 11 years in the defense and intelligence communities helping
analysts create better products from their data. Justin is a Virginia native,
but family drew him to Wisconsin where he now resides with his wife and two
kids. He has a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Radford University in
Virginia.
