Join us for our June virtual PyDistrict. We have two great speakers who will be
presenting.

## Speakers

### Mike Brown - Before you commit, every commit: how to automate code quality

The python community has many tools for linting and enforcing pep8 coding
standards, such as flake8, pylint, and black. Wouldn’t it be nice if these
tools automatically ran — and automatically fixed — your code before it was
pushed?

### Rami Chowdury - Type Checking in Python

You've definitely heard of mypy, and possibly one or more of pytype, pyre, and
pyright.

Holy cow -- that's a lot of options! What should you use? Rami talks about
typechecking your Python for fun... and maybe profit?

Rami has been writing Python for over 10 years and checking types for less than
half of them. He currently helps companies scale their use of Python at
