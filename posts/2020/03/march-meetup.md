Join us for our 1st virtual PyDistrict (formerly Django District) meetup of the
year. We have two great speakers who will be presenting.

### Emma Price - Decision Trees

Decision Trees are used in a wide variety of applications and are great
starting algorithms for visualizing machine learning at work. But what are they
and how can we build them? I hope to provide a more in depth understanding of
performing classification with Decision Trees. This presentation will cover
general terms, examples, and common pitfalls of using Decision Trees for Data
Analysis.

Currently, Emma is a Technologist for Black Cape working on full stack
development for DoD apps. Previously, she was a Software Engineer for Leidos
for 2 years, where she built and researched machine learning algorithms. Emma
received an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering and is passionate
about technology and learning how to harness the power of processing to
increase efficiency in the workforce.

### Zuri Hunter - 4C or Not 4C? That is the question...

This was a question I posed to myself when I was trying to come up with a
presentation with Python. I wanted to know if it was possible to train a
computer on how to determine whether an image had a 4C hair type. This
presentation will cover the trial and tribulations that I came across when
trying to answer that question.

Zuri Hunter is a software engineer at Black Cape, based out in Washington,
DC. She attended the illustrious Howard University where she obtained her
bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems. While completing her undergraduate
degree, Zuri taught herself Ruby on Rails and applied this knowledge at several
local hackathons. She worked on several projects such as the US Presidential
Innovations Fellow, Hack the Pay Gap and AngelHack Incubator, SlimSpace. After
her 5th hackathon she was presented with her first introduction in the tech
industry with opportunity at HumanGeo with web applications in a microservice
architecture.

Outside of building amazing applications, Zuri is heavily involved in
increasing diversity and inclusion within the DC tech community. She volunteers
regularly with Women Who Code as a Ruby on Rails Lead, Black Girls Code as a
Technical Lead, Bison Hacks as a Hackathon Organizer and DCFemTech as
Leadership Lead. As of 2018, she was nominated as DCA Live Power Women in Tech.
When she isn’t volunteering or coding she loves to spend her free time, playing
video games on her PlayStation, watching American Football, doing arts & crafts
and playing billiards at a local club.
