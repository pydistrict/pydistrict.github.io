Join us for our monthly virtual PyDistrict. We'll be welcoming back a former
organizer and seasoned PyCon speaker: **Andrew Baker**.

### Andrew Baker - How I built a $10k ARR side business with Django

Ever thought about bootstrapping your own Software-as-a-Service business?

If you're like me, you registered dozens of domain names over the years for
ideas that didn't *always* see the light of day. After many failed attempts at
creating a self-sustaining side project, I finally got one off the ground last
year: Gator - smart scheduled delivery for your Slack messages.

After about a year and half of nights and weekends work, Gator now pulls in
about $1,000 in revenue per month - which makes it $999 more successful than my
previous best attempt. In this talk I'll share the story of how Gator got off
the ground and some lessons I've learned along the way. I'll also cover some
details of the Python stack I used to build Gator, the APIs I rely on to be
successful, and some communities I found which could help you, too.


Andrew Baker is on a mission to empower developers to change the world with
software.

As Director of Developer Education at Twilio, Andrew leads the teams
responsible for Twilio’s documentation and training programs, including
TwilioQuest.

Andrew started his career as a Python web developer in Washington, D.C.. He
discovered his passion for teaching developers after running Docker workshops
at meetups and conferences before joining Twilio in 2015.

Since then he has sought out new ways to challenge and empower developers
through documentation, training, and other aspects of Twilio’s developer
experience.
