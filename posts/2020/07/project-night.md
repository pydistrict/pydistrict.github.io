Join us on the third Tuesday of the month to work on Python related projects!
Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Have a project you are working on and just need to find the time? Spend a few
hours with other DC Python members bringing your idea into existence.

Even if you don't have a project join in the conversation, learn something new
and share your experience.
