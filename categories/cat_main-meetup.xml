&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Sam Scott - Adding Structure to a Sea of Chaos: A principled approach to authorization using Python + SQLAlchemy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorization is an unstructured problem. Writing code to decide who can do
what in your app can cover a broad set of cases. The most structure that
typically gets applied to this problem area is a set of if statements and
roles, but in reality, there are a lot more patterns and structure that we can
apply. &lt;a href="https://www.osohq.com"&gt;Oso&lt;/a&gt; is an open source batteries-included
library for building authorization in your application. It's a bit like
SQLAlchemy in that it provides a structured approach to authorization, much
like SQLAlchemy does for data modeling and access. In this talk, we'll provide
a mental model for authorization and show how to apply it using oso, Python and
SQLAlchemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;About Sam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Scott is the cofounder and CTO of &lt;a href="https://www.osohq.com"&gt;Oso&lt;/a&gt;. He’s
received a PhD in Cryptography, is an engineer by training, and can discuss
anything from authorization and security patterns in SQLAlchemy, to how oso
works under the hood and interfaces with Python via FFI, to trends in security
policy-as-code and his contributions to TLS 1.3.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll have one great speaker who'll

&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Saran Ahluwalia - Probabilistic Programming using PyStan: Quantifying the business impact of adverse events on networks using device telemetry&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causal Inference has been greatly popularized in the past several years in both
contemporary machine learning and in statistics. Applications include
advertising campaigns, economic analysis and disaster recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is "causal inference"? From a statistician's perspective, it
is the study of the consequences of the effects of individuals' actions. This
is really important as one causal phenomena in your data can be more meaningful
than dozens of correlation patterns in your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will briefly discuss an application of causal inference to
cybersecurity. Objectives in this talk include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to Bayesian structural time series models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to probabilistic programming using Stan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to construct hierarchical models that can capture more complex dynamics
   of systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to network traffic analysis and its utility in impacting
   both cybersecurity and the science of causal inference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;About Saran&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Taylor Bird -  Blueprints for a Serpent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey of Python variants. Let's discuss that Python is a specification for a
language of which cPython is just the most popular reference implementation.
We'll talk at a high level about how this is possible and then we'll cover some
examples of alternate implementations of Python, what they offer and why you
might want to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Justin Shelton - Ball Don't Lie: Extracting Truth from Basketball Games with Python&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain-text can sometimes be a gold mine for analytical information, but text is
not exactly a well-formed API. We will go in depth on how we tackle the problem
of tagging basketball plays for the purposes of advanced metrics with minimal
work, how we present those metrics, and what to do when the data is a lie.
Attendees will learn event modeling for human-readable text; what metrics and
advanced calculations are possible with seemingly basic data; and data
triage/human input on ground-truth data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Shelton is the CTO of Pivot Analysis, a company dedicated to basketball
analytics. He helped create and maintains a system for tracking advanced
basketball analytics, showcasing the effects of players on their teams and
surfacing team insights for coaches and analysts. Before coming to Pivot,
Justin spent 11 years in the defense and intelligence communities helping
analysts create better products from their data. Justin is a Virginia native,
but family drew him to Wisconsin where he now resides with his wife and two
kids. He has a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Radford University in
Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>meetup</category><guid>https://pydistrict.org/posts/2020/09/september-meetup.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 01:45:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>August Meetup</title><link>https://pydistrict.org/posts/2020/08/august-meetup.html</link><dc:creator>PyDistrict</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us for our monthly virtual PyDistrict. We'll be welcoming back a former
organizer and seasoned PyCon speaker: &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Baker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Andrew Baker - How I built a $10k ARR side business with Django&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever thought about bootstrapping your own Software-as-a-Service business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're like me, you registered dozens of domain names over the years for
ideas that didn't &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; see the light of day. After many failed attempts at
creating a self-sustaining side project, I finally got one off the ground last
year: Gator - smart scheduled delivery for your Slack messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a year and half of nights and weekends work, Gator now pulls in
about $1,000 in revenue per month - which makes it $999 more successful than my
previous best attempt. In this talk I'll share the story of how Gator got off
the ground and some lessons I've learned along the way. I'll also cover some
details of the Python stack I used to build Gator, the APIs I rely on to be
successful, and some communities I found which could help you, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Baker is on a mission to empower developers to change the world with
software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Director of Developer Education at Twilio, Andrew leads the teams
responsible for Twilio’s documentation and training programs, including
TwilioQuest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew started his career as a Python web developer in Washington, D.C.. He
discovered his passion for teaching developers after running Docker workshops
at meetups and conferences before joining Twilio in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then he has sought out new ways to challenge and empower developers
through documentation, training, and other aspects of Twilio’s developer
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of his previous presentations:&lt;/p&gt;
